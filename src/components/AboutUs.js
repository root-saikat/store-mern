                            available in top cities in Bangladesh, with each store and website having some unique
                            offering of their own to adult vapers, there are certain brands that are more popular than
                            others. Brands like Joyetech, Innokin, Vaporesso, Aspire were once upon a time the leading
                            vape brands, however now things have changed. Disposables have entered the market and made
                            their mark, and JUUL has seen a sudden increase in popularity followed by a period of
                            minimal growth. Today, the three most popular vape brands in the country are 1) <a
                                href="https://vapestopglobal.com/bd/brands/juul.html">JUUL</a> – the legendary vape
                            brand that is still most used in spite of its controversies, 2) <a

                            disposable brand that is riding on the popularity of disposables, and 3) <a
                                href="https://vapestopglobal.com/bd/brands/smok.html">SMOK</a> – a known vape brand that
                            is still popular especially amongst heavy old-time vapers. Other brands that are popular
                            include IGET and Yuoto.</p>

                        <p className="overlay-content" style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>The market is shifting to closed system
                            vaping devices, meaning in which the e liquid, coils and battery are pre-installed. This
                            removes the need to buy e liquid separately and put in the tank each time the e liquid level
                            drops. In refillable pod devices like JUUL and disposables like <a
                                href="https://vapestopglobal.com/bd/brands/yuoto.html">Yuoto</a>, there is no need or
                            provision to refill with more e liquid. Either the pod or the device is use-and-throw and
                            non-refillable. That being said, some of those who have been vaping since pre 2019 times are
                            still in the habit of vaping brands like SMOK that offer refillable vape devices that need a
                            change of coil and e liquid once every 3 days on average depending on usage. E liquid brands
                            like VGOD, Nasty Juice, and Charlie’s Chalk Dust are the amongst the top 3 brands of e

                        <p className="overlay-content" style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>If you ask the question “Is vaping
                            safe?” – the answer to that is a straight NO. Vaping is not safe. However, if you ask the
                            question “Is vaping safer than smoking?” – then the answer would be that as per the most
                            credible health studies such as by Public Health England (basically the health department of
                            United Kingdom) vaping is significantly less harmful that smoking combustible cigarettes –
                            up to 95% less harmful! So to adults our advice is this: If you do not smoke then do not
                            vape, if you do smoke then quit, if you cannot quit then switch. Vaping is an alternative to
                            smoking for adults above the age of 18 years.</p>
                        <h1><span className="online-cnt" style={{fontSize: '20px'}}>VAPE REGULATION IN BANGLADESH</span></h1>
                        <p className="overlay-content" style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>There is often speculation about the
                            legal standing of e cigarettes when it comes to multiple countries like Nepal, Sri Lanka,
                            Bangladesh etc. Up until recently there was confusion regarding the legal status of vaping
                            in India as well – until in September 2019 when the country decided to ban the category via
                            issuing an ordinance, and then passing the act in both the houses of the parliament. Until
                            then the health officials in India often harassed those in the business of vaping by trying
                            to impose non-legal restrictions stating that the category is already banned. The reality
                            was that if some product is not illegal as per law, it is considered legal. E cigarettes,
                            since they did not contain tobacco, were not classified in the category and act for
                            cigarettes, while they were also not a ‘drug’ as per the per the Drugs &amp; Cosmetics Act.
                            Thus a new act had to be formed which is an elaborate process (and speculated to have been
                            pushed by ITC – a tobacco giant in India in which the government hold indirectly some 30%
                            stake). Similarly, there is currently no act under which e cigarettes or vapes can be
                            categorised in Bangladesh so the statement that thy are illegal here is invalid to begin
                            with. The correct status of e cigarettes in Bangladesh is that they are unregulated and
                            legal. This is the same status that India had before the country wide ban, and the status
                            which currently Nepal also has. </p>

                        <p className="overlay-content" style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>The leading obstacle to the e cigarette
                            industry is the availability of counterfeits or fakes in the market. Almost any popular
                            brand whether it is JUUL or Elf Bar or Yuoto or <a
                                href="https://vapestopglobal.com/bd/brands/iget.html">IGET</a>, each has clone products
                            being manufactured in China and then distributed across the world including Bangladesh.
                            These counterfeits are made in unhygienic conditions with sub-standard and often expired
                            ingredients that can be harmful to one’s health and vaping experience. If you look at how
                            Elf Bar for instance is being manufactured in small dingy rooms with dirt and garbage lying
                            all around, you will think twice before buying a vape that is cheaper than original from a
                            random store. It is therefore vital especially in an unregulated category like e cigarettes
                            which has limited safety checks by the local government, to buy only authentic and original
                            vapes from a reputable global retailer like Vape Stop, which has been in the vape market
                            since 2016 and has a reputation and quality standards.</p>

                        <p className="overlay-content" style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>There is no adult vaper who would like
                            to wait for his/her vape delivery. Like the urge of a smoker who is out of cigarettes and is
                            eagerly looking for a packet of cigarettes, a vaper too is eager to get the brand of
                            preference as the earliest. This is because both e cigarettes and cigarettes contain
                            nicotine, a highly addictive substance. A smoker has two addictions – physiological (the act
                            of hand-to-mouth movement and smoke coming out of mouth), and psychological (the urge
                            satisfied by consuming nicotine). With vaping, both these addictions are addressed, but
                            without the tar (which is formed while smoking conventional cigarettes via the act of
                            ‘burning’). If there is no combustion, then there is no tar, which is one of the deadliest
                            substances consumed while smoking. In vaping, there is a nicotine and flavour glazed vapour
                            that is formed rather than smoke, and hence the term ‘vaping’ as opposed to ‘smoking’. If
                            you are in Dhaka, Chittagong and any other city in Bangladesh and urgently want vapes, then
